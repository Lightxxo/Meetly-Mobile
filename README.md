## Setup and Installation ⚙️

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
    git clone https://github.com/Lightxxo/Meetly.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   **Frontend:**  
        cd Meetly  
        npm install  

   **Backend:**  
        cd server  
        npm install  

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory (and in the `server` folder if required).  
   - Add necessary variables (e.g., MongoDB connection URI, JWT secret).

4. **Run the Application:**  
   **Frontend:**  
        npm run dev  

   **Backend (in a separate terminal):**  
        cd server  
        npm run dev  

   *Tip: Use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for automatic server restarts during development.*

## Sample Data Testing 📊

Meetly includes a dedicated endpoint for populating the database with test data. This feature is especially useful for performance testing, stress testing, and simulating real‐world data volumes.

### Endpoint Details

- **URL:** /sample-data  
- **Method:** POST  
- **Purpose:** To generate interconnected sample records (events, comments, images, RSVPs) in the database.

### Request Payload

    {
      "n": 20,
      "m": 1000
    }

- **`n` (Initial Count):**  
  This sets the baseline number of records. It should typically be set to **20**.

- **`m` (Final Count):**  
  Determines how many records to create. For example, setting `m` to **1000000** will generate 1,000,000 entries, which is useful for testing the system under heavy load.

### How It Works

- **Routing:**  
  The application's router directs any POST requests to `/sample-data` to the designated controller.

- **Controller Processing:**  
  The controller interprets the values of `n` and `m`, and then sequentially generates a series of sample records—including events, comments, images, and RSVP entries—to simulate a populated environment.

- **Use Case:**  
  This endpoint is ideal for developers who need to verify application performance, test data integrity, or simulate heavy traffic scenarios in development or testing environments.  
  **Note:** It is recommended to use this endpoint only in non‐production settings as massive data generation can significantly impact performance.
